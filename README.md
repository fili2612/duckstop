# duckstop
Duckstop is an app i coded for school project.
It is supposed to run on your phone and look when you open a social media and then stop you from using it
please forgive me for inefficient code beacuse i wrote this in 4 days and i dont know any kotlin or java and barely any xml so it barely works
